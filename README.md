# PlotFour

UoD1878 - Virtual Reality Software Engineer

Task:

"Plot Four" is a game in which two players alternate turns dropping red or black discs into a vertically suspended grid measuring 9 x 7. The game concludes either when a player succeeds in forming a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line of four consecutive discs of their color, or when there are no remaining spots available in the grid.

The task consists of designing and implementing a VR prototype of Plot Four using Unity with local multi-player (turn based on the same device). The code will be inspected and executed on a standalone device (Meta Quest 3) or in-editor using a device simulator or Meta Link. To facilitate code evaluation, kindly indicate which device (physical or virtual) and Unity version (suggested LTS version 2021.3.45f1, 2022.3.61f1 or 6000.0.34f1) was used at development time. The aesthetic appeal will not be subject to evaluation, prototyping assets are fine. The focus will be on the game's mechanics and fundamental gameplay. At the beginning of the interview, we will discuss the implementation (up to 10 minutes).

Deadline: 05 May 2025 at 23:59. The applicant can share a zip file of the Unity project or a link to a repository if a distributed version control platform is used (e.g. GitHub).
